# Budgeter: A Budget App

A budget project idea from Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript 2020 course on Udemy that has been modified and expanded upon! Not only does Budgeter automatically balance your budget based on your entered incomes and expenses, it also utilizes your web browser's cache to save your data locally. As long as the browser's cache is not cleared, your expenses and incomes should remain on the table :)

Budgeter allows users to input a month's incomes and expenses so that you can track your spending, allocate money more wisely, or just tally up your subscription costs! Simply select a **+** or **-** for an income or an expense, respectively. Next, Add a description of the income/expense and a value. Budgeter will put your income/expense in the respective column and tally up your total monthly income and expenses. In the expense column, Budgeter will also show you each expense's percentage of the total monthly income! 

## Importance of Files
- **budget_imgs** folder: contains background photo **back.png**
- **budgeter.html**: HTML markup for the app
- **budgeter.css**: stylesheet for the app
- **budgeter.js**: main JS file for the app

## To-do:
- **Authentication**: In the future, instead of simply relying on a browser's cache, I would like to implement a username and password authentication system with Node and Express.
